Albright
========

Albright provides gateways to external api's by mapping 'fsxml type requests' to FsList 
type responses. So making external resources act like normal fsxml requests. 

1) Check out Albright in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Deploy the war on a Tomcat server
